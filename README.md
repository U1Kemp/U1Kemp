# 👋 Hi, I’m Utpalraj Kemprai

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m someone still figuring things out — drawn to the logic of mathematics, the patterns in data, and the occasional beauty of a well-fit model. While my curiosity isn’t always burning at full throttle, I keep going — learning bit by bit, sometimes out of passion, sometimes out of discipline. I don’t romanticize the grind, but I do find small joys in building, understanding, and making things work (especially when paired with a good anime OST in the background).

- 👀 Interests: Causal Inference, Statistical Modeling, ML, and quietly judging plots with poor axis labels  
- 🌸 Also Interests: Anime, Japanese music (yes, Chilli Beans supremacy), and the eternal question — "Sub or Dub?" (Sub. Always.)

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Survival Analysis with R (because why let lifetimes be boring?)  
- Causal Inference (a.k.a., "Did X really cause Y or are we just imagining things?")  
- Bayesian Statistics (Trust the prior, even when life doesn't update in your favor)
- Japanese (slowly — anime subtitles are still doing most of the heavy lifting)
